# ClickHouse Meetup Hosted by Cloudflare
These are the presentations from the ClickHouse Meetup Hosted by Cloudflare in London on 19 September, 2023

## Details
Join us at the magnificent Cloudflare office in central London for our next ClickHouse Community Meetup!

Cloudflare, one of the early adopters of ClickHouse will provide an insightful talk on how they use ClickHouse at a massive scale for various applications.

Streamkap will be presenting a talk highlighting their stream processing platform. Real-time metrics and logs for Streamkap's platform are achieved with ClickHouse, through a simpler architecture, sub-second response times and 90% cost saving compared to Opensearch.

We look forward to seeing you there!
