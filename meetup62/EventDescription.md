We are very excited to be holding our next in-person ClickHouse meetup at the amazing Cloudflare office space in central London.

As one of the early adopters of ClickHouse, Cloudflare will share their story about how they use ClickHouse at a large scale for their internal analytics workload, bot management, customer dashboards, and many other systems. Hear tips around schema management at scale and how they enable 100s of engineers to modify ClickHouse schemas.

Clippd will present how ClickHouse provides analytics capabilities for their new platform which allows golfers and golf instructors to input, connect and elevate performance data.

The ClickHouse team will share their latest updates and are available for plenty of questions.

Please join us for an evening of talks, food and discussion.

See you there!
