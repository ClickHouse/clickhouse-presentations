Abstracts
Don't manage Data Infrastructure yourself: Clickhouse Tips for Growing Start-ups
Fingerprint, a device identity platform, helps engineers prevent fraud, enhance user experiences, and better understand their traffic.

As a growing company focused on data-driven algorithms for identification and anti-fraud, we needed a top-notch data infrastructure without overextending our limited engineering resources. Initially, we struggled and made several mistakes but eventually learned valuable lessons and discovered various tips and tricks for employing a modern data stack (Clickhouse Cloud, dbt, Preset). This talk will share our insights, targeted at growing companies with small data teams (1-3 members), to help you optimize your data infrastructure without sacrificing your core product development.
